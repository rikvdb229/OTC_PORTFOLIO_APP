The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.1] - 2025-10-07

### ‚ú® New Features
- **Belgian Time-Based Updates**: Price updates now enforced after 09:00 Belgian time using external time API
  - No dependency on user's local system clock
  - Automatic DST handling via WorldTimeAPI and TimeAPI.io
  - Smart scheduling: auto-enables update button when time reached
  - Hybrid reliability: setTimeout + polling backup (handles computer sleep)
  - One update per day enforcement

### üîß Technical Improvements
- **New Time Service**: `services/timeService.js` provides Belgian time verification
  - Primary: WorldTimeAPI (http://worldtimeapi.org)
  - Fallback: TimeAPI.io (https://timeapi.io)
  - 2-minute buffer (09:02) ensures bank data is published
- **Smart Update Scheduler**: Auto-schedules update if app opens before 09:00
  - Primary timer to exact time (09:02)
  - Polling backup every 10 minutes (catches timer failures)
  - Both canceled once update completes
- **Enhanced Auto-Update**: Works correctly even if app starts before 09:00

### üîí Enforcement Rules
- Updates blocked before 09:00 Belgian time (clear user message with current time)
- Updates blocked if already updated today
- Applies to all grant types (KBC, ING, mixed portfolios)

### üéØ User Experience
- Button states: "Available after 09:00" / "Update available" / "‚úÖ Updated Today"
- Auto-enables at 09:00 (no manual refresh needed)
- Respects auto-update setting
- Works offline after initial time check

## [0.4.0] - 2025-10-06

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT: Backup your database before installing this release.** While database migrations are tested, we recommend exporting your portfolio data (Settings ‚Üí Export Database) before updating as a safety precaution.

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes - ING Grants

- **Fixed ING Grant Value Calculation**: ING grants now display correct total values in Portfolio tab
  - Root cause: ING API was returning price quotes with value = 0, which were being stored in database
  - Added filtering to exclude zero/null prices at all levels: API fetch, historical scraper, and database storage
  - Implemented database migration to automatically clean existing zero prices on app startup
  - ING grants now correctly contribute to total portfolio value calculations

- **Fixed Price History Matching**: Corrected price lookup for grants with same exercise price
  - Updated price_history JOIN to match on both `exercise_price` AND `grant_date` (previously only exercise_price)
  - Ensures grants with identical exercise prices but different grant dates get correct historical prices
  - Aligns portfolio overview calculation with evolution timeline logic
  - Particularly important for ING grants where multiple grants can share same underlying value

### üîß Technical Improvements

- **Enhanced ING Quote Validation**:
  - `fetchIngQuotes()` now filters out quotes with price ‚â§ 0 before processing
  - Historical scraper validates and reports filtered zero prices
  - Database storage layer prevents zero prices from being persisted
  - Clear error messages when all prices for an ISIN are zero

- **Database Migration System**:
  - Added `migrateRemoveZeroPrices()` migration to clean legacy data
  - Automatically removes zero/null prices from price_history table
  - Logs count of cleaned entries for transparency
  - Runs on app startup via existing migration framework

- **Improved Error Handling**:
  - Better error messages for ING grants with no valid price data
  - Prevents crashes when ING API returns invalid data
  - Graceful fallbacks for edge cases

### üì¶ Upgrade Notes

1. **Automatic Migration**: On first launch of v0.4.0, zero prices will be automatically removed from your database
2. **Re-fetch ING Prices**: After upgrade, update prices for ING grants to fetch clean historical data
3. **Portfolio Values**: ING grant values should now display correctly in Portfolio tab and contribute to total portfolio value
4. **Evolution Timeline**: ING grants now properly appear in evolution timeline with "Grant received" notes (same as KBC grants)

### üôè Acknowledgments

Thanks to users who reported the ING grant value issue and helped identify the zero price root cause.
