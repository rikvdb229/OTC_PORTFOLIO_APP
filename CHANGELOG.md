## [0.3.1] - 2025-08-10

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Update Notice
**After updating to v0.3.1, users should run Settings ‚Üí Update Historical Prices** to benefit from the new performance optimizations and ensure portfolio data integrity. This rebuilds your portfolio timeline using the dramatically improved in-memory processing introduced in this version.

### üöÄ Performance Improvements
- **Optimized Evolution Timeline Recalculation**: Dramatically improved speed using in-memory data processing instead of database queries per date
- **Intelligent Partial Rebuilds**: Evolution timeline now rebuilds only from affected dates instead of complete recalculation, improving performance by up to 70%
- **Pre-loaded Data Processing**: Added `calculatePortfolioStateOptimized` method for efficient batch data processing

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes
- **Fixed SQL Binding Errors**: Resolved "Wrong API use: tried to bind a value of an unknown type (undefined)" error when updating sales
- **Fixed Portfolio Entry Deletion**: Resolved "getPortfolioStateAsOfDate is not a function" error when deleting portfolio entries
- **Fixed Loading Indicators**: Added missing spinner animations for tax update operations
- **Fixed UI Label Issues**: Corrected "Current option:" label display during evolution timeline rebuild phase
- **Fixed Version Display**: Resolved version showing "Loading..." in packaged builds with retry mechanism and fallback values

### üîÑ Code Quality & Maintenance
- **Removed Dead Code**: Cleaned up ~240 lines of obsolete recalculation methods and duplicate functions
- **Standardized Operations**: All portfolio operations now use the same optimized recalculation approach for consistency
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added proper parameter validation and SQL.js binding patterns throughout
- **Dynamic Version Management**: Window title and footer now properly fetch version information from package.json

### ‚ö° Technical Enhancements
- Tax amount updates now properly trigger evolution recalculation (affects unrealized gains calculations)
- Enhanced createPortfolioSnapshot method with optimized portfolio state calculation
- Improved IPC communication reliability in packaged builds
- Better fallback handling for version display in offline scenarios

### üõ†Ô∏è Developer Experience
- Consistent SQL.js binding patterns across all database operations
- Improved debugging with better error messages and logging
- Streamlined codebase with unified recalculation methodology

## [0.3.0] - 2025-08-10

### Added
- **üïê Historical Price Management System**: Complete historical price integration
  - **Automatic Historical Price Fetching**: System automatically fetches real grant date prices when adding new grants
  - **Smart Price Derivation**: Intelligently derives missing grant date prices from next available trading day
  - **Bulk Historical Updates**: Settings ‚Üí "Update Historical Prices" to rebuild historical data for entire portfolio
  - **Real-time Progress Tracking**: Visual progress bars for both price fetching and portfolio recalculation phases
  - **Data Quality Handling**: System rounds derived prices to nearest 10 for consistency (e.g., 50.41 ‚Üí 50.00)
- **Enhanced Grant Addition Workflow**: 
  - Historical price modal with detailed fetch progress and results
  - Visual indicators for derived prices with tooltips explaining the source
  - User-controlled workflow - users manually proceed after reviewing fetched prices
- **Intelligent Progress Management**:
  - Timeline rebuild progress with detailed step-by-step feedback
  - Optimized progress updates (every 10%) to prevent UI overwhelming
  - Clear phase separation between data fetching and portfolio recalculation

### Enhanced
- **Portfolio Evolution Accuracy**: Portfolio timeline now uses actual historical grant date prices instead of hardcoded ‚Ç¨10 values
- **Database Migration System**: Automatic migration for existing users to populate historical grant date prices
- **Price Update Efficiency**: Auto-update on startup only runs when prices are actually outdated, reducing unnecessary scraping
- **User Experience**: Historical price fetch modal no longer auto-closes, giving users control over the workflow

### Fixed
- **Grant Date Price Accuracy**: Replaced all hardcoded ‚Ç¨10 values with real historical prices from grant dates
- **Timeline Rebuild Progress**: Fixed "18/17" display issue and static progress bar during portfolio recalculation
- **Tax Calculations**: Tax estimates now use actual fetched grant date prices instead of hardcoded values
- **Modal Management**: Historical price fetch modal properly shows only close button (not cancel) and prevents accidental closure during fetch
- **Performance Issues**: Reduced historical price update frequency to prevent UI freezing during large portfolio rebuilds

### Technical Improvements
- **Enhanced Historical Scraper**: Added grant date price derivation logic with comprehensive logging
- **Database Schema**: Added `grant_date_price` column with proper migration handling for existing users  
- **Progress Reporting**: Backend methods now support progress callbacks for real-time UI updates
- **Error Handling**: Improved error handling and user feedback during historical price operations
- **CSS Styling**: Added visual styling for derived price indicators with hover tooltips

### Performance Notes
- **Processing Time**: Historical price updates can take 5-15 minutes for large portfolios depending on grant count
- **Internet Requirement**: Historical price fetching requires active internet connection
- **Background Processing**: System processes historical data in phases with clear visual feedback

## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-02
